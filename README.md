# eink-todoList
Code to use a Raspberry Pi Zero as an automatically updating to do list that gathers information from a google sheets worksheet.

If you plan to use this yourself the file contents of "eink-todoList/v1/credential_key_file_pomodoro.json" will need to be populated with your own private api key from google.
Instructions on how to obtain this key can be found here: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys
